2,Jan 12,3,Hicks (Markowitz),"Guest presentation. Design principles, sampling designs, logistics and estimation. (Ray Webster) 
Guest presentation. Case study for implementing survey design (Zack Oyafuso)."
2,Jan 14,4,Kotwicki (Markowitz),"Student presentations on project plan: 5 minutes presentation, 5-10 minutes for discussion.
Some general topics
a. Design of a new survey from the ground up.
b. Analysis of existing survey data (e.g. present survey data product and its uncertainty, use of survey data in assessments, role of uncertainty in assessment).
c. Literature review of a survey topic under active research.

Examples of literature overview. Opportunity for students to ask questions about class projects."

3,Jan 21,5,Kotwicki (Wassermann),"Overview of current hot topics in survey science: Uncertainty (observation error), Survey continuity (flexibility and catchability), multispecies optimisation, flexible survey design, model-based estimation of survey data products, simulations, statistical tools and new technology. Combining surveys. Absolute indices of abundance (catchability). Changes in technology affect continuity but also improve estimates. Using observation from fishing vessels.

Second part of the class will consist of discussion topics picked by students after the lecture. We will pick 4 topics of interest to students, prioritize them and discuss them in detail."
4,Jan 26,6,Hicks (Markowitz),"Examples of combining surveys into one platform and/or combining different data types across platforms to improve survey products. Combining acoustic/trawl data and integrating NW and SW acoustic surveys.
Main topics: changes to survey, calibration, scientific and legal process.
