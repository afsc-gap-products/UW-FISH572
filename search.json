    "text": "0.7 Course Summary\nThe course covers the science and practice of fishery-independent surveys, the primary monitoring approach supporting fisheries management. Fishery-independent surveys form the foundation for stock assessments and ecosystem research, which will be exemplified by case studies from the field. The course covers survey designs for different objectives, types of data collections, and data products from fisheries-independent surveys. It explores the newest developments and challenges in survey science, from observation to spatial and temporal analysis, and introduces career opportunities in the field of scientific surveys. Practical challenges in implementing these principles and managing fisheries-independent surveys will be discussed. You will learn how survey data products inform marine research, stock assessment, ecosystem analysis, and ultimately accumulate into fisheries management advice.\n\n\n\nCourse flyer\n\n\nThis course is designed for students with a background in basic statistics, statistical modeling, and fisheries/wildlife science. It covers a wide range of topics, including:\n\nSurvey Design: Learn about various survey designs for different objectives, types of data collection, and the resulting data products.\nData Analysis: Gain practical skills in analyzing fisheries-independent survey data using both design and model-based methods.\nCurrent Topics: Explore the latest developments and challenges in survey science, such as uncertainty, survey continuity, effort optimization, flexible survey design, and the use of statistical tools and new technology.\nReal-World Applications: Understand the logistical challenges in implementing and managing fisheries-independent surveys, and how survey data products are used in fisheries research, assessment, and management advice.\nCareer Opportunities: Discover career paths in the field of research surveys.\n\nThe course format includes lectures from instructors and visiting experts, student-led literature reviews and discussions, and hands-on survey data analysis. A significant portion of the grade is based on a final research project using survey data, providing students with valuable experience in research planning and execution. This class is designed to provide useful skills for ongoing research in the field.",

Lectures will focus on a range of topics, described with examples from different survey programs around the world. Lecture slides will be made available on the course website for downloading and reviewing.\nLiterature review and discussion sections: Students (in groups of 1-3) will be responsible for presentations on relevant literature and leading subsequent discussions in-class. Approximately one-quarter of in-class time will be used for these presentations and discussionsPresentations will include a summary of relevant scientific papers on a chosen survey-related topic and all students will be expected to actively participate in discussions. List of papers for student presentations and discussion will be provided by instructors, but students will be given the opportunity to propose a paper of their choice for presentations. The point of the discussion section is to read peer-reviewed literature and become familiar with current topics in survey science.\nSurvey data analysis: Each student will be responsible for one mid-course project to include survey data analysis on a data set of their choice (data sets from several actual surveys will be available, as needed). Analysis can involve estimation of standard design-based or model-based survey data products or could involve custom analysis for class projects.\nResearch plan and final paper: Half of the student grade is based on a final written research paper using survey data. Topics for the final paper will be proposed by students and will be presented for class discussion and feedback within the first 3 weeks of the quarter.",
