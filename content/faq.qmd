<summary><h3>*Why fisheries-independent surveys are important?*</h3></summary>
<br>
Fisheries-independent surveys are a foundation of fisheries stock assessment and ecosystem research. They are crucial for tracking trends in fish stocks globally. These surveys provide consistent time series data that are used in stock and ecosystem assessments.

Here's how they are useful:

 - **Foundation for Research and Management:** Fisheries-independent surveys are considered a cornerstone for fisheries stock assessment and ecosystem research. They are instrumental in focusing attention, triggering opinions, and stimulating ideas, discussion, and activity in specific research fields.
 - **Data Collection and Products:** The surveys provide data products used in ecosystem processes research, ecological studies, stock assessment, and forecasting. They offer observations of fish abundance, environmental parameters, species distribution, the discovery of new taxa, and  community structure.
