This page provides an overview of the graded assignments in the course. More specific materials can be found in a sibling repository https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/UW-FISH572-coursework. This repository includes [coursework](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/UW-FISH572-coursework/tree/main/coursework) and folders for [student to share, store, and submit assignments](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/UW-FISH572-coursework/tree/main/studentwork). 



### Project plan - 1 page and 5 min presentation (10% weight) {.unnumbered}
**DUE: Presentation January 14**

Within the first days of the quarter students will be responsible for planning a research project. Students can propose a project of their choice as long as the data for the project is of survey origin. Project plans should be discussed with and accepted by instructors. Once accepted students will be responsible for writing a 1 page project plan and for presentation of the plan during the class. Instructors and students will provide feedback on the plan during the class discussion. 

### Literature review 20-30 min presentation on the survey topic (20%) {.unnumbered}
**DUE: Presentation February 9**

Students will be responsible for presentations on relevant literature and leading subsequent discussion. Literature review presentations will be conducted on Feb 9 or later depending on the number of presentations. Papers for this literature review should be relevant to the final  project. Students are advised to discuss potential papers for this review with instructors, but students will be given the opportunity to propose a paper(s) of their choice for presentations. Literature review presentation will be followed by Q & A session and in-class discussion on the presented topics

### Survey data analysis (20%) {.unnumbered}
**DUE: Paper February 16**

Simulations are crucial in fisheries survey research because they allow scientists to test and refine survey designs, evaluate uncertainty and bias, and improve the reliability and efficiency of data used for sustainable fishery management. An example that we will use to explore this in class can be found [here](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/UW-FISH572-coursework/blob/main/simulationDescription.pdf).
This assignment will involve estimation of standard design-based and model-based survey data products (from provided “true distributions”) or could involve custom analysis of survey data used for class projects. Format of the analysis presentation will be open and can include analysis description and graphs or tables. Analysis will be graded separately, but can be included as part of the final paper or as an independent document. Data analysis will be due at the end of week 6 of the course.  

### Final project - up to 5-8 pages and 20-30 min presentation (50%) {.unnumbered}
**Due: Presentation March 4-11; Paper March 13**

Final project results will be presented in the form of 20-30 minutes in-class PPT presentation. Students will receive feedback from instructors and time for in-class discussion will be provided. Presentations will occur during the last 2 weeks of the course. Final 5 - 8 page paper will be due at the end of week 10 and graded during the week of finals.

Example ideas for final projects are provided below.

- Designing a new survey from scratch: This project option allows students to apply the principles of fishery-independent surveys learned in the course to a practical scenario. They would need to consider various aspects such as the survey objectives, target species, study area, sampling design (e.g., random, stratified random, systematic), choice of gear, operational protocols, data collection methods, and potential challenges and biases. This involves developing a comprehensive survey plan that is scientifically sound and logistically feasible. It's an opportunity to think critically about how to obtain data to support survey objectives.
- Analyzing existing survey data: This option involves working with pre-collected fishery-independent survey data. Students could choose to focus on deriving survey data product, such as an abundance index or a distribution map, along with an assessment of its uncertainty under alternative scenarios. Alternatively, they could examine how survey data is used in stock assessments or delve into the role of uncertainty in assessment models. Students should show how to apply statistical and analytical techniques to real-world data, interpret the results, and understand the implications for fisheries science and management. It provides hands-on experience with the types of data products that inform management decisions.
- Conducting a literature review: For this project, students would select a survey topic that is currently an active area of research in fishery-independent surveys. They would then conduct a thorough review of the relevant scientific literature, synthesizing the current state of knowledge, identifying key research questions and methodologies, and highlighting areas of ongoing debate or future research needs. This option allows students to deepen their understanding of a specific aspect of fishery-independent surveys and develop their skills in critically evaluating scientific literature. It's a good way to explore cutting-edge developments and challenges in the field.

The final project can serve as a chapter of a student's dissertation, provided it utilizes survey data. This indicates that the project options are designed to be substantial and rigorous enough to contribute to a graduate-level research thesis
