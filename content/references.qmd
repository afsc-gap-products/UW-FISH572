# NOAA quarto book with R and download PDF or docx

This is a template for [a simple Quarto book](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/NOAA-quarto-book/) (`type: book`). It has download links (under the logo) for PDF or docx download.

The repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the book (html, PDF, and docx) automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the `gh-pages` branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.
