<em>Why are fisheries-independent surveys important?</em>
</h3>
</summary>
<p><br> Fisheries-independent surveys are a foundation of fisheries stock assessment and ecosystem research. They are crucial for tracking trends in fish stocks globally. These surveys provide consistent time series data that are used in stock and ecosystem assessments.</p>
<p>Here are more details on how fisheries-independent surveys are useful:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Foundation for Research and Management:</strong> Fisheries-independent surveys are considered a cornerstone for fisheries stock assessment and ecosystem research. They are instrumental in informing resource assessments and stimulating ideas, discussion, and analysis in fisheries and ecological research fields.</li>
<li><strong>Data Collection and Products:</strong> Surveys provide data products used in ecosystem processes research, ecological studies, stock assessment, and forecasting. They offer observations of fish abundance, environmental variables, species distribution, community structure, and the discovery of new taxa.</li>
<li><strong>Unbiased Information about Change:</strong> Unlike data obtained from commercial or recreational fisheries, surveys aim to obtain samples based on statistically rigorous designs. This allows for the inference that observed changes in an abundance index, or other types of data over time, are indicative of true changes in abundance and other population characteristics such age size- or age-structure.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Assessment Input:</strong> Fish stock assessment models require abundance indices as a measure of the relative or absolute abundance of a population. Estimates of abundance index uncertainty are often incorporated into these models as model-weighting criteria.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and Adaptation:</strong> Surveys are conducted worldwide to determine the status of marine populations and characterize the state of marine ecosystems. As marine ecosystems change and technology advances, modernizing survey tools allows us to maintain critical survey time series and deliver the best available science to support sustainable fisheries management. This includes adapting to changes in ecosystems and technology by evolving approaches to survey design, estimation, and methods.</li>

<em>Why learning about fisheries-independent surveys is critical to prepare you well for future collaboration with artificial intelligence (AI)?</em>
</h3>
</summary>
<p><br></p>
<p>Learning about fisheries-independent surveys, as a data collection tool, can prepare you well for future collaboration with AI for several key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding Data Quality and Bias:</strong> AI models are highly dependent on the quality and objectivity of the data they are trained on. Fisheries-independent surveys are specifically designed to collect high-quality data through statistically rigorous designs. By understanding these methods, you learn to recognize and appreciate the importance of data integrity. This knowledge is crucial when working with AI, as you will be able to identify potential biases in datasets and assess the reliability of AI-driven insights, ensuring the AI is learning from sound information.</li>
<li><strong>Data Structure and Organization:</strong> Surveys generate structured time series data, including observations of abundance, environmental variables, species distribution, and community structure. Understanding how these data are collected, organized, and stored (e.g., in databases) is fundamental. This knowledge directly translates to preparing data for AI algorithms, which often require well-structured and standardized inputs. You’ll be better equipped to design data pipelines and ensure compatibility between survey outputs and AI models.</li>
<li><strong>Uncertainty Quantification:</strong> Fisheries-independent surveys inherently deal with uncertainty in their estimates (e.g., in abundance indices). The course explicitly covers topics like uncertainty and how it is incorporated into stock assessment models. This focus on quantifying and managing uncertainty is highly relevant to AI, as many AI models also produce predictions with associated uncertainties, but some may not propagate uncertainty as desired. Your understanding of survey-derived uncertainty will enable you to better interpret AI model outputs, evaluate their confidence, and even contribute to developing AI models that explicitly account for data uncertainty.</li>
<li><strong>Identifying Key Variables and Relationships:</strong> Through learning about survey design and analysis, you’ll gain an understanding of which environmental and biological variables are critical for understanding fish populations and ecosystems. This domain expertise is invaluable when collaborating with AI. You can guide AI in identifying relevant features for its analysis, suggest appropriate modeling approaches, and validate whether the AI’s findings align with ecological principles. Without this important context and framing, AI models are much less useful.</li>
<li><strong>Interpreting Model Outputs:</strong> The course emphasizes how survey data products are used in ecosystem processes research, ecological studies, stock assessment, and forecasting. This gives you experience in interpreting complex scientific data and model outputs. When AI is applied to fisheries data, it will generate its own set of outputs (e.g., predictions, classifications, anomaly detections). Your background in interpreting survey-derived insights will allow you to critically evaluate AI-generated information and discern its practical implications for fisheries management.</li>
<li><strong>Adapting to New Technologies:</strong> The course highlights the importance of modernizing survey tools and adapting to new technology. This forward-looking perspective fosters an open mind towards integrating innovative solutions, including AI, into fisheries science. Your exposure to evolving design, estimation, and technology within surveys will make you more receptive to, and capable of, leveraging AI for advanced data analysis and informing management.</li>
</ul>
In essence, a deep understanding of fisheries-independent surveys provides you with a robust foundation in data collection principles, data quality assessment, uncertainty management, and domain-specific knowledge – all of which are critical for effective and responsible collaboration with artificial intelligence in the evolving field of fisheries science.

<em>What is the future of fisheries-independent surveys?</em>
</h3>
</summary>
<p><br></p>
<p>The future of fisheries-independent surveys is characterized by continuous modernization and adaptation to dynamic marine ecosystems and rapid technological advancements.</p>
<p>Key aspects of this future include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Responding to Environmental and Anthropogenic Changes:</strong> Surveys will need to continuously adapt to shifts in species distribution due to climate change, increased human activities in survey areas (e.g., offshore wind farms, marine protected areas), and disruptions from extreme weather events. This requires changing sampling extents and combining information across multiple jurisdictions.</li>
<li><strong>Technological Integration and Modernization:</strong> The future will see the incremental incorporation of advanced technologies, rather than wholesale replacement of existing methods. This includes:
<ul>
<li><strong>New Sampling Technologies:</strong> Increasingly sophisticated and high-resolution acoustics, eDNA (environmental DNA), and optical techniques will become more widespread. eDNA, for instance, shows promise for detecting rare species, quantifying community composition, and estimating abundance.</li>
<li><strong>Evolving Platforms:</strong> While crewed research vessels will remain key, surveys will be augmented and potentially partially replaced by uncrewed and autonomous platforms like uncrewed surface vehicles (USVs), remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and even animal-borne sensors. Stationary platforms (piers, moorings, seabed landers) and satellites will also contribute data.</li>
<li><strong>Data Processing and Transmission:</strong> Improvements in data storage, processing, and near real-time transmission from sea to land will enable adaptive sampling decisions and remote involvement of scientists and stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML):</strong> AI/ML will play an increasingly significant role in rapidly processing large, multidisciplinary observational datasets, identifying and counting organisms (e.g., scallops from camera footage), and informing adaptive sampling designs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Expansion of Survey Objectives:</strong> Surveys are evolving beyond single-taxon stock assessments to become comprehensive platforms for ecosystem monitoring. This means collecting a wider range of biotic and abiotic data, including oceanographic variables (salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH), physiological status, condition, food habits, genetics, and even microplastics, to support ecosystem-based fisheries management and climate change forecasting.</li>
<li><strong>Advancements in Statistical Methods:</strong> Rapid advancements in spatial statistical methods, including spatio-temporal models, will be crucial. These models will facilitate estimation from unbalanced data (i.e., data with spatial or temporal gaps), bridge time series across changes in survey effort or design, and help optimize survey designs for efficiency and precision, even under budget constraints.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible and Multi-Platform Designs:</strong> Future surveys will prioritize flexibility in design to continuously adapt to changes in ecosystem conditions along with manager and stakeholder needs. This will involve using probabilistic sampling designs, parsimonious stratification, and designing surveys to be “platform-agnostic,” allowing the integration of data from various sources (e.g., trawl, acoustics, eDNA, video) and multiple platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Addressing Resource Constraints:</strong> Static budgets necessitate innovative approaches, including increased use of commercial vessel platforms for surveys and exploring cost-recovery models, while carefully assessing tradeoffs between cost-saving measures and data quality.</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining Consistency and Continuity:</strong> A core challenge and priority for the future is to manage change while ensuring the consistency and comparability of long-term time series data. This will involve careful calibration of new and old methods, running parallel operations, and using model-based approaches to account for method differences.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Automation and Data Accessibility:</strong> There will be a drive towards greater automation in sampling and data analysis to ensure timely access to data. Furthermore, data products will need to be standardized and accessible to a broad range of stakeholders, aligning with open science and data-sharing policies.</li>
</ul>
In summary, the future of fisheries-independent surveys is not about wholesale replacement, but rather about strategic, incremental integration of advanced technologies, sophisticated statistical methods, and broadened ecological objectives, all while rigorously maintaining the invaluable consistency of long-term data series to inform sustainable fisheries and ecosystem management in a dynamic world.
